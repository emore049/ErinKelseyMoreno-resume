        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Pre-Business Major student studying at University of California, Riverside. For the future, I am interested in concentrating in Management. I want to further this and eventually go into Health Care Management. Growing up, I was unsure of what I wanted to become and originally thought of becoming a Dentist. I later realized that I wanted to go into the Business field, especially after learning about it from my mother, who is in accounting. My interest towards business grew even more after taking various courses at UCR. Classes such as Microeconomics and Introduction to Business taught me valuable lessons and skills that I hope to utilize in the future. I have also been very interested in exploring business organizations that will allow me to build my general and networking skills. This coming summer, I have a planned internship at Sac Health System. With my intended concentration in Health Care Management, having an internship at a clinic will be beneficial towards my future goal. 
 <br><br>

       I have enjoyed being in various leadership positions throughout my high school experience which has enabled me to grow skills I would not have otherwise. These positions include being a senator,parliamentarian, and secretary for two years. With each position, I had to adjust to new tasks and responsibilities that were upheld. Through being a senator, I learned to work with others and to follow through with every task. As a parliamentarian, I gained the skills to maintain order and effectiveness within meetings and events. I found secretary to be my most rewarding position after learning how to properly organize and compile meeting minutes and notes. I was also assigned the task to keep track of every vote and decision. I find all of these positions helpful in the progression of my character and leadership skills. <br><br>

       Along with these positions, I was a part of my high schoolâ€™s National Honors Society. To get accepted into the National Honors Society, I had to showcase and apply with my previous experience with volunteering and leadership. After showing that I was well qualified in both areas, I was accepted my junior year. Being in the National Honors Society gave me opportunities to volunteer and encouraged me to exemplify the four pillars of the society: scholarship, leadership, community service, and character. Although many of my leadership skills have been learned in high school, I hope to continue to learn and become involved throughout college.
